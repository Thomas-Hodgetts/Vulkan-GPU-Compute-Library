# Vulkan-GPU-Compute-Library

# About
What this project focuses on is providing a simplified method to set up and access the resources of the GPU. It provides access to GPU memory as well as management and as well as providing methods for executing code. It is built on Vulkan 1.3 and C++ 17 as well as JSON for Modern C++ for any error output. 

# Background
This project was developed over one year for a Master of Research. It has been a project I have wished to tackle ever since finishing my undergraduate degree. In my undergraduate degree I wished to create a library to simplify certain aspects of utilizing GPU compute, this was highlighted when I tried to develop a rope physics engine that uses the GPU. 

# Goals
I will be working on this repository continuously to polish the code and to improve aspects of the project, even after the hand in deadline. There are also some things I would like to try out on project such as making it run on Linux and providing some documentation. 

# To Do
- Work on Linux porting.
- Clean up the backend vkGenerics file.
- Comment all code.
- Provide documentation.
